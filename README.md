# Classification-with-R
In this project, I will describe and discover structure in a wrangled dataset, train and validate my models, and interpret the best model in a professional quality report. For each significant step, I will document my results, interpretations, assumptions, and process. I will select a target categorical variable to model with <b>Logistic Regression</b>, <b>K-NN</b>, and <b>Classification Trees</b>.
